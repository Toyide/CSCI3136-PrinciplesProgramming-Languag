<p id="yui_3_17_2_2_1461096353598_257"><b>Every person has a right to respect and safety. We believe inclusiveness is fundamental to education and learning. Misogyny and other disrespectful behaviour in our classrooms, on our campus, on social media, and in our community is unacceptable. As a community, we must stand for equality and hold ourselves to a higher standard.</b></p>
<p>What we all need to do:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Be Ready to Act:</b>&nbsp;This starts with promising yourself to speak up to help prevent it from happening again. Whatever it takes, summon your courage to address the issue. Try to approach the issue with open-ended questions like &ldquo;Why did you say that?&rdquo; or &ldquo;How did you develop that belief?&rdquo;</li>
<li><b>Identify the Behaviour</b>: Use reflective listening and avoid labelling, name-calling, or assigning blame to the person. Focus the conversation on the behaviour, not on the person. For example, &ldquo;The comment you just made sounded racist, is that what you intended?&rdquo; is a better approach than &ldquo;Youre a racist if you make comments like that.&rdquo;</li>
<li><b>Appeal to Principles:</b>&nbsp;This can work well if the person is known to you, like a friend, sibling, or co-worker. For example, &ldquo;I have always thought of you as a fair-minded person, so it shocks me when I hear you say something like that.&rdquo;</li>
<li><b>Set Limits:</b>&nbsp;You cannot control another persons actions, but you can control what happens in your space. Do not be afraid to ask someone &ldquo;Please do not tell racist jokes in my presence anymore&rdquo; or state &ldquo;This classroom is not a place where I allow homophobia to occur.&rdquo; After you have set that expectation, make sure you consistently maintain it.</li>
<li><b>Find or be an Ally:&nbsp;</b>Seek out like-minded people that support your views, and help support others in their challenges. Leading by example can be a powerful way to inspire others to do the same.</li>
<li><b>Be Vigilant:</b>&nbsp;Change can happen slowly, but do not let this deter you. Stay prepared, keep speaking up, and do not let yourself be silenced.</li>
</ol>
