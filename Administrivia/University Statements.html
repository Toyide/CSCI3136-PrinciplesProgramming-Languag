<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>At Dalhousie University, we are guided in all of our work by the values of academic integrity: honesty, trust, fairness, responsibility and respect (The Center for Academic Integrity, Duke University, 1999). As a student, you are required to demonstrate these values in all of the work you do. The University provides policies and procedures that every member of the university community is required to follow to ensure academic integrity.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dal.ca/dept/university_secretariat/academic-integrity.html">http://www.dal.ca/dept/university_secretariat/academic-integrity.html</a></p>
<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>The Advising and Access Services Centre is Dalhousie&rsquo;s centre of expertise for student accessibility and accommodation. The advising team works with students who request accommodation as a result of: a disability, religious obligation, or any barrier related to any other characteristic protected under Human Rights legislation (NS, NB, PEI, NFLD).&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dal.ca/campus_life/student_services/academic-support/accessibility.html">http://www.dal.ca/campus_life/student_services/academic-support/accessibility.html</a></p>
<h2>Student Code of Conduct</h2>
<p>Everyone at Dalhousie is expected to treat others with dignity and respect. The Code of Student Conduct allows Dalhousie to take disciplinary action if students dont follow this community expectation. When appropriate, violations of the code can be resolved in a reasonable and informal mannerperhaps&nbsp;through a restorative justice process. If an informal resolution cant be reached, or would be inappropriate, procedures exist for formal dispute resolution.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dal.ca/campus_life/safety-respect/student-rights-and-responsibilities/student-life-policies/">https://www.dal.ca/campus_life/safety-respect/student-rights-and-responsibilities/student-life-policies/</a>code-of-student-conduct.html</p>
<h2>Diversity and Inclusion &ndash; Culture of Respect</h2>
<p>Every person at Dalhousie has a right to be respected and safe. We believe inclusiveness is funda- mental to education. We stand for equality. Dalhousie is strengthened in our diversity. We are a respectful and inclusive community. We are committed to being a place where everyone feels welcome and supported, which is why our Strategic Direction prioritizes fostering a culture of diversity and inclusiveness (Strategic Priority 5.2).&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dal.ca/cultureofrespect.html">http://www.dal.ca/cultureofrespect.html</a></p>
