<p>Students may request accommodation as a result of barriers related&nbsp;to disability, religious obligation, or any characteristic under&nbsp;the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act. Students who require academic&nbsp;accommodation for either classroom participation or the writing of&nbsp;tests and exams should make their request to the Advising and Access&nbsp;Services Center (AASC) prior to or at the outset of the regular&nbsp;academic year. Please visit www.dal.ca/access for more information&nbsp;and to obtain the Request for Accommodation &ndash; Form A.</p>
<p>A note taker may be required as part of a student&rsquo;s accommodation.&nbsp;There is an honorarium of \$75/course/term (with some exceptions).&nbsp;If you are interested, please contact AASC at 494-2836 for more&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>Please note that your classroom may contain specialized accessible&nbsp;furniture and equipment. It is important that these items remain&nbsp;in the classroom, untouched, so that students who require their&nbsp;usage will be able to participate in the class.</p>
