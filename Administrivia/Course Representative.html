<p>Our Course Representative is ???? (???).</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Course&nbsp;Representative is a point of contact to facilitate and provide more timely feedback mechanisms to instructors and to the Faculty of Computer Science. Additionally,&nbsp;Course&nbsp;Representatives&nbsp;can assist peers in navigating to the most appropriate support mechanism on campus. You can think of a CR as &lsquo;the middle person&rsquo;; a neutral point of contact for students to use when they don&rsquo;t&nbsp;feel comfortable addressing an issue with the professor directly.</p>
